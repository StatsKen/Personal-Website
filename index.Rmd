I'm a Biostatistics PhD candidate at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.

Iâ€™m currently working on evaluating time-varying intervention effects in Cluster Randomized Trials, fixed effects models for the analysis of Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Trials, and developing methods to control for bias in Self-Controlled Case Series.
